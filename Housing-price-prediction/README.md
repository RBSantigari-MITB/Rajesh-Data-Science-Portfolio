# Predicting California Housing Prices using Linear Regression & EDA

This project builds a Linear Regression model to predict median house values in California  
using housing-related features such as median income, rooms, bedrooms, population, and household size.

**Contents:**
- Jupyter notebook (`housing_price_prediction_linear_regression.ipynb`)
- Dataset (`housing.csv`)
- Model evaluation (RMSE, R²)
- Visualization of actual vs predicted house prices
